# **Thyme 2 Collect**
#### An Inventory / Archiving Tool
##### _*Title in Development_

### Concept & Goal(s):
    A flexible and interactive archive to organize and locate otherwise forgotten items or information.
        - Able to Filter and Sort information in these tables for quicker use
        - Add, Delete or Update new entries as needed 
            - Columns
            - Items
            - Tables / Folders
        - Add Collaborators (Add Authentication Levels)
        - Combining / Merging 
        - Share (Publically or Privately)

### Inspiration:
We see these systems quite frequenly but I have yet to see a reliable option for most casual consumers. Retail companies track inventory with information such as category, description(s), price, location, status of stock, potential tracking information and more. Libraries can tell you where a book is and what it may be about, even tracking locally-stored reviews. But what about someone who has a personal library or someone who wants to keep track of where family heirlooms are kept amungst storage? (I forsee a system like this greatly minimalizing the disorgonazion in something like a will or splitting/combining assets.) What about collectors who want to showcase their pride with other collectors and compare details? What about someone trying to keep track of their items in a garage sale when their kid(s) bring their friends around to scatter toys that are decidedly not-for-sale amungst the space? After toying with the concept for a while I've tried to search for something to use, and there are some resources out there, but they didn't quite perform the way I needed them to (with emphasis on the sorting and filtering relational content). 

#### Potential Template Opportunities:
- Card Collections (Such as Baseball or Pokemon)
- Recepies / CookBook(s)
- Books / Library
- Stoarge Inventory
- Closet / Wardrobe
- Educational Materials / Notes / #StudyBuddy
- Contact Directory (Employees, Customers/Clients, Partners, Guests, General Friends & Family)
- Reports & Project Management
- Mover's Aid 
    - (ie:) Item | Item Desc. | Fragile _y/n_ | Container Desc. | Container Location | Destination | Other
- And Many More
